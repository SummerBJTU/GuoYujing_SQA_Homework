# Summary of Week 2

Chapter 4
Because of some reasons people sometimes misunderstood that the software quality assurance process is to deal with defects. When people focus on handling defects , they will find the defects related to many factors . The exact way used to handle defects is also influenced by the specific QA activities that led to their initial discovery, the project environment, and other factors in the discovery of defects and deficiencies in the process of treatment.
There are several important activities :Defect logging, Defect tracking, Consistent defect interpretation and tracking and Emely defect reporting. 
Processing defects are a very important part of QA, but in many organizations, defect handling is implicitly assumed to be part of the project management activities, which is handled in similar ways as configuration management. In the fourth chapter also talked about the discovery of defects and handling defects and other QA activities. These QA activities can also be partitioned into verification and validation (V & V) activities using a bi-partite classification scheme in the so-called V & V view.

Chapter 5
The fifth chapter talked about the various activities and process of quality engineering . Quality engineering process includes the following aspects :
1 Pre-QA activities: Quality planning.
2 In-QA activities: Executing planned QA activities and handling discovered defects.
3 Post-QA activities: Quality measurement, assessment and improvement.
Of course , the quality of works in the software industry will have to use the concept SQA. Meanwhile, at different stages of the life cycle, quality assurance into force is different .

Chapter 6
The sixth chapter talked about the testing including testing activities and processes , and how testing fits into the overall software quality assurance (QA) activities.
Testing fulfills two primary purposes:
1 to demonstrate quality or proper behavior;
2 to detect and fix problems.
The major test activities include the following in roughly chronological order:
1 Testplanning andpreparation
2 Test execution
3 Analysis and follow-up
