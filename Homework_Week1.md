1 My Understanding of Software Quality Assurance

  
  Talk about SQA, I think the first concept is some standard such as ISO 9000 or a model such as CMMI.
  Software quality assurance consists of a means of monitoring the software engineering processes and methods used to ensure quality.
  The methods by which this is accomplished are many and varied, and may include ensuring conformance to one or more standards.
  SQA encompasses the entire software development process, which includes processes such as requirements definition, software design, coding, source code control, code reviews, change management, configuration management, testing, release management, and product integration. 
  SQA is organized into goals, commitments, abilities, activities, measurements, and verifications.
